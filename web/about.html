            <p class="text">
                Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
                Mental health manifestations and perceptions vary widely across different cultures. For example, in some cultures, mental health issues may be expressed through physical symptoms rather than emotional ones. Cultural context can influence how symptoms are experienced and reported.

                Spending time in nature has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health. Activities like walking in a park, gardening, or even viewing images of nature can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression.
                The stigma around mental health is gradually decreasing, but it remains a significant barrier to seeking treatment. Efforts to normalize mental health discussions, such as mental health awareness campaigns, have made positive strides in reducing stigma.

                Why is mental health important for overall health?
            </h3>
            
            <p class="text">
                Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  For example, depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.

                Can your mental health change over time?
            </h3>
            
            <p class="text">
                Yes, it’s important to remember that a person’s mental health can change over time, depending on many factors.  When the demands placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities, their mental health could be impacted. For example, if someone is working long hours, caring for a relative, or experiencing economic hardship, they may experience poor mental health.
